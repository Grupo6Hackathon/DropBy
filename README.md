## DROPBY APPLICATION PROJECT

This was the project we developed for our Hackathon, the final event of our programming bootcamp.
In 24 hours we had to come up with the idea, execute it and present it to our fellow Code Cadets, Master Coders, IT company representatives and more.

## The Idea

We were given a theme and a song to extrapolate from. The theme was 'Push and Pop' and the song was 'Cheguei' by 'Ludmilla'.
We took the songs main message about being able to be free and to show who we are as the main concept for our application. In the sense that our app can bring different people toghether for lots of different reasons, we thought it was appropriate.
DropBy is a platform that people can use to connect and share what they enjoy with others. With DropBy you can plan events and/or participate in others. Wether you'd like to share your cooking skills by opening your house as a restaurant for a night, throw a party in your backyard or a concert in your garage, you can find people willing to bask in on the experience.

## The Development

Our group was made out of 5 awesome developers that had never met before. Through solid communication and teamwork we were able to branch our work in order to reach our MVP goals and even further.
We managed to early on establish our branching according to our strengths which resulted in very clear paths for both back end and front end development.
We started by exploring our options with mock-up design and UML schematics. We created a REST API to respond to our data requests using a MySQL database. We also built a functional front end with the user experience in mind.

## Tech && Methodologies

Java, Linux, Mac OS, Spring MVC, Hibernate, MySQL, Tomcat, Maven, Git, Scrum, HTML5, CSS3, Thymeleaf.
IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code.

## Connect to our application

In order to connect to our application, use maven $ mvn tomcat7:deploy to deploy the project to your local tomcat service. Tomcat should be configured for localhost:8080 - if not, please update the project files.
Open the http://localhost:8080/dropby/index in any browser and you should be ready to go.
